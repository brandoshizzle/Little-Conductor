## To Do

-   1. Replace playlist albums (0.5 hours) **(DS: I'm assuming this means a refresh with the albums that are already on there? If so, yes)**
-   2. Don't add any albums that exist on the playlist already (0.3 hours)
-   3. Reorder albums by dragging (2 hours) **(DS: It would be nice if they were little blocks that could be moved around)**
-   4. Input list of playlist urls from sheets and give back list of followers to paste back (2 hours)
-   5. Having the ability to paste in a column of playlist links and follow all of the ones I am currently not already following (1.5 hour)
-   6. Add n first, push last n (1.5 hours)
-   7. Add tags to playlists (4 hours)


## UI
-   Make left pannel ~1/2 the size so the right pannel stretches out causing each row to take up less vertical real estate
-   Bold header row (i.e. "Name", "Description" etc.)
-   Bold Playlist name
-   Make description text a few points smaller and potentially italicize? In general it would be nice if each playlist takes up ~1/2 the vertical space
-   Clicking on playlist title opens up new tab/window directing to the playlist URL
-   Instead of checkmark in checkbox, something rude and offensive like a butt or penis or something
-   Colours: dark greens, browns, hints of blue - It would be nice if it felt naturesque

## Maybe later

-   Confirm delete
-   Create new playlist

## Done

-   Albums listed as chips
-   Filter out playlists if they don't have LS songs or are empty
-   In-UI console
-   Playlist last update (in days)
-   Playlist length (in time)
